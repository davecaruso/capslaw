just a rough plan. let me know your thoughts. for now, it's back to crunch time for me.

	SCHEDULE

	TASK								WHOSE TASK IT IS			WHEN IT'S DUE

	[it'll be kinda like this https://youtu.be/s6uCc8fQ-ao at 6:55 but designed to look like a scrubber]

	"Cold Outside" beatmap draft 1		Timmy						October 23, 11:59 PM
	Playtest with at least 1 person		Both Of Us					October 25, 11:59 PM



	STRETCH GOALS						Anyone who has spare time	Any time before it's due
	Motion blur and animations for flair text
	Screenshake and Combo shit (just calibri bold, bottom right, maybe flair captions get rainbow text)
	"Insane Mode" (missing letters are nondeterministic, different every time)			
	Plan it so that we clip him playing the game, and by the end of his runthrough, the last level is of him reacting to the beginning of the game

	Flair text between levels (just a brief aside where it's like, "this next bit requires a typing speed of xyz wpm. good luck, fucker! GAHAHAA")
