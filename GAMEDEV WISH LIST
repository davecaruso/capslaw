BETTER WORD WHITELIST

MAP:
	sometimes a mistake respawns me to the middle of a word and i don't know where in the word i am because the entire word is green

	please make the hue of the green for the bar = the hue from the green of the correct hit marks

CUTSCENE:



captions of the clip are off by a few frames in the second cutscene

timing in the first clip seems odd now (webm issue?), with glitches towards the very end
I think it's erroneously applying your ". . ." slowdown where it shouldn't be applied


i think if our goal is to be truly foddian, we should try to minimize the gap between the A and B sections
the "start the REAL game" kind of implies that there's infighting between the developers, which there isn't

BOTH:

for both cutscenes AND maps, please, an _amplitude tag_ in json/txt,  (changes amplituide of the video file from this moment on, until it changes again)
the levels are mixed really poorly and inconsistently across the entire game, sometimes in the same level
